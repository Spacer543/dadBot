# dadBot

**dadBot** is a simple plugin that responds to messages starting with variations of "I am" with a classic dad joke:  
*"Hi (anything after "I am")! I'm dad."*

## Features

- Responds to any message that begins with "I am" in various forms.
- Customizable response delay.

_More features will be added if people actually download this plugin._

## Configuration

You can adjust the response delay by modifying the `seconds_to_wait` parameter in the `config.yml` file. The default wait time is set to **1 second**.

### Example Configuration (`config.yml`)

```yaml
seconds_to_wait: 1 # How long should Dad take to respond?
```

## Installation

1. Download plugin.
  
2. Drop it into your server plugins folder!

## Usage

Once the bot is running, send a message starting with "I am" (e.g., "I am hungry"). The bot will respond with the dad joke.
